## Step 3/5

1. Go to https://glitch.com/ and create an account with the same name as your GitHub account.
Click the “ Sign Up ” button and follow the instructions.

2. Get started with your first project!
In the upper right-hand side of the main page (after you log in!) you will see a button “New Project”.
Click on this button; then click on “hello-webpage”.

You will see these files on the left:
- README.md: A file where you can describe your project in markdown. Think of it as the front
page for other developers
- index.html: Where you’ll write your HTML
- style.css: Where you’ll write your CSS
- You can ignore the script.js for now, this exercise is about HTML and CSS only.
